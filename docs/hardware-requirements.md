# Hardware and Software Requirements

This document outlines the necessary hardware and software for each course tier. Requirements are presented in three tiers: Simulation, Small Robot, and Full Build, to accommodate different learning levels and project scopes.

## Tier Definitions

*   **Simulation Tier**: Focuses on software-based simulation environments (e.g., ROS 2, Isaac Sim). Requires a capable PC for running simulators.
*   **Small Robot Tier**: Involves basic physical robotics. Requires a Raspberry Pi, servos, and essential components for learning fundamental control.
*   **Full Build Tier**: For advanced projects requiring more powerful hardware, including a 3D printer for custom parts and more robust computing for complex simulations or ML.

## 1. Simulation Tier

This tier is designed for students who wish to focus on software-based simulations and development without requiring physical hardware initially.

*   **Hardware**:
    *   A modern laptop or desktop computer.
    *   **Minimum Specifications**: [Placeholder for minimum PC specs - e.g., CPU, RAM, GPU if relevant for Isaac Sim]
    *   **Recommended Specifications**: [Placeholder for recommended PC specs]
*   **Software**:
    *   Operating System: Ubuntu (LTS recommended)
    *   Development Environment: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
    *   Simulation Software: Isaac Sim (or other specified simulation platforms)
    *   Version Control: Git
*   **Estimated Costs (Late 2025)**:

| Currency | Estimated Range |
|----------|-----------------|
| PKR      | Approx. ₹20,000 - ₹60,000 |
| USD      | Approx. $250 - $750 |

## 2. Small Robot Tier

This tier is for students who want to work with basic physical robotics. It builds upon the simulation tier's software requirements and adds essential hardware.

*   **Hardware**:
    *   Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 Model B or newer)
    *   Basic servo motors (e.g., SG90 or similar)
    *   Power supply for Raspberry Pi and servos
    *   Jumper wires and breadboard
    *   Basic tools (screwdrivers, wire strippers)
    *   Optional: Basic robot chassis kit
*   **Software**:
    *   Operating System: Ubuntu (LTS recommended, installed on RPi)
    *   Development Environment: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
    *   IDE: VS Code with relevant extensions (e.g., C++, Python, Remote - SSH)
    *   Version Control: Git
*   **Estimated Costs (Late 2025)**:

| Currency | Estimated Range |
|----------|-----------------|
| PKR      | Approx. ₹40,000 - ₹100,000 |
| USD      | Approx. $500 - $1200 |

## 3. Full Build Tier

This tier is for advanced students undertaking comprehensive projects, requiring more powerful hardware and tools, including 3D printing capabilities.

*   **Hardware**:
    *   Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 Model B or newer, or equivalent SBC)
    *   More powerful servo motors or actuators
    *   High-quality power supply and distribution
    *   Advanced sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth cameras)
    *   3D Printer and filament
    *   Dedicated workstation/PC for intensive tasks (e.g., simulations, CAD, ML training)
    *   Optional: Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) for low-level control
*   **Software**:
    *   Operating System: Ubuntu (LTS recommended, dual-boot or dedicated machine)
    *   Development Environment: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
    *   Simulation Software: Isaac Sim (or more advanced simulation platforms)
    *   CAD Software: Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or similar (student licenses may be available)
    *   Version Control: Git
    *   Optional: Machine Learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   **Estimated Costs (Late 2025)**:

| Currency | Estimated Range |
|----------|-----------------|
| PKR      | Approx. ₹150,000 - ₹400,000+ |
| USD      | Approx. $1800 - $4800+ |
